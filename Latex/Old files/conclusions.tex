\chapter{Conclusions}
In this report we have described various improvements that we developed to
better tune the Kernel Search algorithm to the MKP\@.

Some of these improvements, such as Item Dominance and the Single Knapsack Heuristic
improve the performance and quality of the algorithm,
and thus can be seen as an improvement across the board.
Others, such as the Instance reduction and the Repetition Counter
usually worsen the results obtained but, depending on how they are configured,
they allow to find more solutions quickly and to diversificate the solution space.
